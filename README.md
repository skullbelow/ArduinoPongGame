# ArduinoPongGame

This project is an exercise in serial communications and creativity. This game is inspired by Pong where you hit a "ball" which are shown as LEDs coming towards a pushbutton that is in turn pressed to hit the ball back. The NRF24L01 Tranceivers allow the breadboards to communicate relevant information between eachother using wireless SPI.

## Hardware List:
- 2 Arduino Unos
- 2 Breadboards
- 2 NRF24L01 Tranceiver Modules
- 8 LEDs
- 2 Pushbuttons
- 2 10k Ohm Transistors
- Male to Female wires ( A BUNCH )
- Male to Male wires ( A BUNCH )
